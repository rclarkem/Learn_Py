# Variables in Python

Variables in python are used to store values such as primitive and complex values.

The way we store the data is by assigning is to the variable with an equal sign.

ex:

```py
x = 3
```

We store the integer `3` into the variable `x`.

## Variable Conventions

Variables are written using snake case styling:

- All lowercase letters
- Cannot begin with anything other than a letter or underscore
  - If you want spacing, you must use underscores
-
- Should be informative/descriptive and tell you what the variable is describing
- **All caps indicates a constants**
