# Learn Python

My personal notebook for learning Python.

I have created a section called [Notes](https://github.com/rclarkem/Learn_Py/tree/main/Notes) that contains sections of what I am learning and I will also be including a section called [ProblemSets](https://github.com/rclarkem/Learn_Py/tree/main/ProblemSets) to work on as well. If you find this helpful feel free to fork, clone, etc.
