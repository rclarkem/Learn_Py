# Learn Python

My personal notebook for learning Python.

I have created a section called `[Notes]('./Notes')` that contains sections of what I am learning and I will also be including a section called `[ProblemSets]('./ProblemSets')` to work on as well. If you find this helpful feel free to fork, clone, etc.
