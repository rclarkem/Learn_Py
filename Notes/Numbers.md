# Numbers in Python

Python has two number types:

1. Integers: Whole numbers

ex: `2`

<!--  markdownlint-disable -->

2. Floats: Numbers with floating point, for example, decimals are floating points

ex: `2.0` or `2.9998`

<br>

## Number Methods & Arithemetic

- `+`
- `-`
- `/` --> Division: This will result in a floating point number
- `//` --> Integer Division : This will result in an integer number
- `%` --> The modulo: Results in the remainder of division
- `**` --> exponents

<br>

### Augmented Assignment Operator

```py
x = 3
x = x + 3 # or to shorten:
x += 3
# 6
```

This can be used with other operators such as multiplication or subtraction, etc.

### Some Common Methods

`round`: round to the nearest whole integer

`abs`: absolute value of a number

### Math module

[python mathematical functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) using `math module`

Can use the module to access other methods to perform mathematical operation on expressions:

Import the math module: an object with built in functions. Similar to `Math` in JS but must be imported at the top of file globally.
